High priority:
	- Commenting the code using Doxygen
	- Adding mass outputs/inputs registration file
	- Updating widgets to GTK+ 3
	- Activating editor

Medium priority:
	- Iterative algorithm to correct gauges
	- Dates in solute boundary conditions and in transient sections.
	- Result file (and subdirectory) in the same directory that the input file.

Low priority:
	- Animation controlled by a dial
	- Label of the section in junctions and inner boundary conditions
	- Stable numerical method with high sized cells
